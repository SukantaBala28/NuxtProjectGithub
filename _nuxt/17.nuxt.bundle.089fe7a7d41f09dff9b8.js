But the population of Canada is only one fifth of Russia. Canada has turned into a country of the old people. 16 % of Canada’s population is above the age of 65 and in 20 years it will be increased to 24%. (Statistics Canada).  All the Baby-Boomers are Retiring and that’s why Canada will face acute labour shortage very soon. The birth rate of Canada is very lessand senior people are more in number than the children in Canada. The Conference Board of Canada has recommended to bring at least 413, 000 immigrants every year to keep Canada’s economy running. And that’s why Canada is bringing thousands of immigrants every year. The number is increasing every year. 320,932 immigrants came in the year 2015-16 which is three times greater than the year 2014.  3035 candidates have been issued an invitation to apply in the latest express entry draw which was held on August 23/2017. The latest draw saw a minimum Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score requirement of 434.

Those candidates who receive an ITA mayapply for Canadian permanent resident status."),t("br"),t("br"),e._v("\n\t\t\tThere were two other draws held on August 2 and 9 in 2017.

Saskatchewan has received more quota to bring skilled immigrants in Express Entry and Occupation in Demand category, Skilled Immigrants in this category are coming to Canada without any job offer. Saskatchewan has been bringing skilled immigrants in these categories since 2015. These nominees are getting 600 extra points and thus the nominees are able to apply for federal immigration very easily. The provincial nominee program is introduced to all provinces including Manitoba, British Columbia, Alberta, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. As a result, a lot of skilled immigrants are coming to the provinces without any job offer. On June 6/2017, there were only 50-200 points (Depending on the NOC) in the Express Entry CRS points system. Whereas, there were 600 points for a job offer previously. So, it was hard to come only with skills. But now, it’s easier.  Now there is point if a candidate has siblings in Canada, there is extra point for French Language ability, there is point for Canadian education and for Canadian job experience. So.
